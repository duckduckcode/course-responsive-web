# Overview

When learners begin to explore responsive web design, they often jump straight to media queries, becuase media queries are something new, and something specifically made for responsive design.

But good responsive design begins with the basic principles of CSS. I often see students with huuuuuge media queries, with whole different designs wrapped inside a "mobile only" condition. But man yof the most powerful responsive techniques can be achieved with just percentage-based sizing, view-based styling, flexbox, and grid layouts.
