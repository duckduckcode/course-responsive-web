# Dev Tools

Goal: Understand how to use the Responsive Design features of the Chrome Developer Tools

## Opening Dev Tools

The developer tools can be opened using a keyboard shortcut, or from the Chrome menu.

The shortcut for Windows is `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I`

The shortcut for Mac is `Command` + `Option` + `I`

The letter "I" stands for "inspect".

## Elements Tab

This tab shows you information about the HTML and CSS used on the current page. It is the most helpful developer tools tab to use for responsive design.

To show the nested content inside any HTML element, click the small triangle to the left of it.

To edit a part of the HTML, double click it. You can edit the element type, attributes, classes, or content for any HTML element. Press enter to apply your changes.

The Styles panel shows all CSS which has been applied to the selected HTML element, including default styles added by Chrome.

To edit a CSS property or its value, click on it. Press enter to apply.

To add a CSS property, click in the empty white space of the very first style section called `element.style`. Type in your new style and then press enter to apply.

## Element Selector

To turn on the element selector, click the small arrow icon at the top left of the developer tools.

With the element selector active, you can click on any HTML element in the page, and it will become selected in the developer tools. This is a quick way to jump to an element of interest in the HTML panel. Click the icon again to turn off the element selector.

## Device Toolbar

To turn on the device toolbar, click the small mobile/tablet icon at the top left of the developer tools.

With the device toolbar activated, you are given extra options related to testing different screen sizes.

### Screen size dropdown

Use this dropdown to select from a collection of common screen sizes. The "Responsive" option allows you to resize the preview window to any size you need.

### Screen Dimensions

The screen dimensions tell you the current size of the preview window.

### Zoom

The zoom functionality allows you to zoom out to preview screen sizes larger than your own computer monitor.

### Connection Speed

The connectivity dropdown allows you to simulate the loading speeds of a mobile connection. Make a selection and then reload your page to see it load using a speed-limited connection.

### Device Rotation

This option lets you switch between landscape and portrait mode for your selected device.
