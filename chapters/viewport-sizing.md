# Viewport Sizing

Open this link then follow the instructions:



## Use view-relative sizing for heights

The vh measurement is like %, but itâ€™s a percentage
of the view height not the container height.

```
.header {
  height: 60vh;
}
```

Your header box should resize as the browser height changes.

## Title Text

The vh and vw units can also be used
for font sizes, instead of using pixels.

```
.title {
  font-size: 8vw;
}
```

Your page title should resize as the browser height changes.


## Completed
